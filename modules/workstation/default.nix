/* GENERAL WORKSTATION CONFIGURATION
 *
 * A workstation is a computer with it's own screen,
 * keyboard and (sometimes) mouse. It can also sometimes
 * play music or print (provided the correct satanic
 * sacrifice was precured first).
 *
 * Some of the modules included by this file depend on
 * root access on a system (nixos-rebuild), while some
 * can be operated entirely in userspace.
